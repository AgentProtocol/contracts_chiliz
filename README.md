# ContractMe - Chiliz Chain Smart Contract

A buy-in system smart contract built Chiliz Chain that implements logarithmic cost scaling and prize pool management.

## üèüÔ∏è Features

- **Logarithmic Cost Scaling**: Buy-in costs increase using the formula `Fee‚Çô = BaseFee √ó (1 + log‚ÇÇ(n + 1))`
- **Prize Pool Management**: Automated prize pool accumulation with owner-controlled payouts
- **Owner Fee Structure**: 5% developer fee, 95% goes to prize pool
- **Upgradeable Parameters**: Owner can update base fees and reset costs
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive events for frontend integration
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in checks to prevent overflows and unauthorized access

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask wallet configured for Chiliz Chain

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd contracts_chiliz
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
CHILISCAN_API_KEY=your-chiliscan-api-key
```

### Development

1. **Compile contracts:**

```bash
npm run compile
```

2. **Run tests:**

```bash
npm run test
```

3. **Deploy to Spicy Testnet:**

```bash
npm run deploy:spicy
```

4. **Deploy to Chiliz Mainnet:**

```bash
npm run deploy:chiliz
```

## üìä Cost Calculation Example

The contract uses a logarithmic formula to calculate buy-in costs:

```
Fee‚ÇÅ = 2.5 CHZ √ó (1 + log‚ÇÇ(1 + 1)) = 2.5 CHZ √ó (1 + 1) = 5.0 CHZ
Fee‚ÇÇ = 2.5 CHZ √ó (1 + log‚ÇÇ(2 + 1)) = 2.5 CHZ √ó (1 + 1.58) = 6.45 CHZ
Fee‚ÇÉ = 2.5 CHZ √ó (1 + log‚ÇÇ(3 + 1)) = 2.5 CHZ √ó (1 + 2) = 7.5 CHZ
```

## üìù Contract Events

The contract emits the following events for frontend integration:

```solidity
event BuyIn(address indexed user, uint256 cost, uint256 buyInNumber);
event PrizeFunded(address indexed funder, uint256 amount);
event Payout(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);
event CostReset(uint256 newBuyInCount);
event ContractDrained(uint256 prizePoolAmount, uint256 ownerFeesAmount);
event BaseFeeUpdated(uint256 oldBaseFee, uint256 newBaseFee);
event OwnerFeesWithdrawn(address indexed owner, uint256 amount);
```

## üîí Security Features

- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions protected by `onlyOwner` modifier
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated for zero addresses and amounts
- **Overflow Protection**: Built-in SafeMath operations
- **Payout Limits**: Payouts cannot exceed available prize pool
- **Emergency Pause**: Owner can pause contract operations if needed

## üß™ Testing
